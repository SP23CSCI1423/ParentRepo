Create a perl file called HealthyOrNot.pl and a perl module file called Food.pm

1. In the Food.pm file create two subroutines:
	Candy subroutine: Prints 4 types of candy
	Veggie subroutine: Prints 4 different vegetables
2. In the HealthyOrNot.pl file, ask the user if they want healthy food or candy
3. Call the correct subroutine in the Food.pm file depending on their choice
   (So if they say healthy food, call Veggie, if they say candy, call Candy)
