Ask the user for their name and age
Print what year they will turn 50
Print what year they will retire (age 65)
Print what year they will turn 100

In your code you should be doing the necessary calculations for each of these tasks, 
and clearly label each print statement so we know which year is for which print statement. 
Each print statement should also include the user's name.
