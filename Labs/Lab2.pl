#Make two arrays
#First array should have three family members names and ages (so you could have their first name, then their age)
#Print the entire array, then everyone's age
#Second array should have three movies and their release date (so their title, then the release date)
#Print the entire array, then print the second movie and it's release date

#NOTE: Names and ages, and then movies and release date, should be separate variables (so like ("john", 34) for example)
#NOTE: The print statements should be separate
