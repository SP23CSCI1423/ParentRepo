Create a file called Vowels.pl

In the file, create a scalar with a sentence that has at least 6 words in it
Using regular expresions, search for vowels within the scalar (a,e,i,o,u)
Create a scalar that keeps track of the number of vowels so every time it finds one, the count increases by one
Print the total number of vowels found
