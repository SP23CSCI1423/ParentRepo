Create a file called SubSandwich.pl

1. Create three subroutines, Ham, Club, and Rueben, that hold the ingredients of each sandwich
   Each subroutine should print the ingredients
2. Ask the user which sandwich they would like to eat
3. After the sandwich has been chosen, call the appropriate subroutine
   (So if the user picks Ham, it should call the Ham subroutine)

Be sure to have one subroutine per sandwich (so there should be three subroutines) and to call them Ham, Club, and Rueben
If you don't know the ingredients of the sandwich, feel free to look it up
